Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful wizards: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. They chose to split the students into four ‘houses’, each bearing their surnames and featuring young wizards and witches who displayed abilities and personalities they wanted to nurture.

To do this, Godric Gryffindor used his magical hat – henceforward known as the Sorting Hat – to decide which children should go into which house, and so it has been ever since with a yearly Sorting Ceremony that places each new pupil into their own new home.

The four houses have different entry requirements, and nobody summed them up better than the old Sorting Hat itself in its welcoming song...

‘You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart.’

## Hufflepuff <img src="https://github.com/Samarth-Khatri/Sorting-Hat/blob/main/images/H.png" width="20px">
‘You might belong in Hufflepuff
Where they are just and loyal
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil.’

## Ravenclaw <img src="https://github.com/Samarth-Khatri/Sorting-Hat/blob/main/images/R.png" width="20px">
‘Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw
If you’ve a ready mind
Where those of wit and learning
Will always find their kind.’

## Slytherin <img src="https://github.com/Samarth-Khatri/Sorting-Hat/blob/main/images/S.png" width="20px">
‘Or perhaps in Slytherin
You’ll make your real friends
Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends.’
